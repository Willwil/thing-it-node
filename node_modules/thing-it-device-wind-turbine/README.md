[thing-it-node] Device Plugin for a generic Wind Turbine Generator as a demo for wind park management.


## Installation

### Installation of NodeJS and [thing-it-node]

First, install node.js and **[thing-it-node]** on your Raspberry Pi following the instructions on the [[thing-it-node] Wiki](https://github.com/marcgille/thing-it-node/wiki/Raspberry-Pi-Installation).

To let the Pi comunicate with the Atlas Device you have to activate  the Pis **I2C** interface via
 
```
sudo raspi-config
```
 
Choose **8. Advanced Options** and then **7. I2C**.
 
### Initialization and Start of [thing-it-node] 

The **[thing-it-device-wind-turbine]** Plugin is installed with **[thing-it-node]**, hence there is no need to install it separately.

The Plugin is simulation-only so far, hence you only have to create a directory in which you intend to run the configuration, e.g.
 
```
mkdir ~/atlas-scientific-test
cd ~/atlas-scientific-test
```

and invoke

```
tin init
```

and then start **[thing-it-node]** via

```
tin run
```

Note, that at this point Autodiscovery would only discover distinct products such as pH meter or temperature sensor. It will not be able to distinguish between two
pH meters if you set up an I2C bus as opposed to the single device setup above.

If you don't want to use Autodiscovery, you may use configurations like the [sample configuration]("./examples.configuration") via

```
tin example --device wind-turbine
```

If you want to pair the **[thing-it-node]** Gateway and its sample configuration with [thing-it.com](https://www.thing-it.com), invoke

```
tin pair --mesh Test
```

and enter your [thing-it.com](https://www.thing-it.com) account and password. The pairing will allow you to configure and monitor your local Gateway from 
[thing-it.com](https://www.thing-it.com) and use the Mobile App below to connect to the Gateway from everywhere.

## Mobile UI

Install the **thing-it Mobile App** from the Apple Appstore or Google Play and set it up to connect to **[thing-it-node]** 
locally as described [here](https://thing-it.com/thing-it/#/documentationPanel/mobileClient/connectionModes) or just connect your browser under 
[http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to check how the Mobile UI would look like.

The following screenshot shows the Node Page of the [sample configuration]("./examples.configuration"), which just defines 3 pH Meters:
