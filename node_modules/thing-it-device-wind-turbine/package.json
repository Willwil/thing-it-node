Advanced Options** and then **7. I2C**.\n \n### Initialization and Start of [thing-it-node] \n\nThe **[thing-it-device-wind-turbine]** Plugin is installed with **[thing-it-node]**, hence there is no need to install it separately.\n\nThe Plugin is simulation-only so far, hence you only have to create a directory in which you intend to run the configuration, e.g.\n \n```\nmkdir ~/atlas-scientific-test\ncd ~/atlas-scientific-test\n```\n\nand invoke\n\n```\ntin init\n```\n\nand then start **[thing-it-node]** via\n\n```\ntin run\n```\n\nNote, that at this point Autodiscovery would only discover distinct products such as pH meter or temperature sensor. It will not be able to distinguish between two\npH meters if you set up an I2C bus as opposed to the single device setup above.\n\nIf you don't want to use Autodiscovery, you may use configurations like the [sample configuration](\"./examples.configuration\") via\n\n```\ntin example --device wind-turbine\n```\n\nIf you want to pair the **[thing-it-node]** Gateway and its sample configuration with [thing-it.com](https://www.thing-it.com), invoke\n\n```\ntin pair --mesh Test\n```\n\nand enter your [thing-it.com](https://www.thing-it.com) account and password. The pairing will allow you to configure and monitor your local Gateway from \n[thing-it.com](https://www.thing-it.com) and use the Mobile App below to connect to the Gateway from everywhere.\n\n## Mobile UI\n\nInstall the **thing-it Mobile App** from the Apple Appstore or Google Play and set it up to connect to **[thing-it-node]** \nlocally as described [here](https://thing-it.com/thing-it/#/documentationPanel/mobileClient/connectionModes) or just connect your browser under \n[http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to check how the Mobile UI would look like.\n\nThe following screenshot shows the Node Page of the [sample configuration](\"./examples.configuration\"), which just defines 3 pH Meters:\n\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"./documentation/images/mobile-ui.png\"><img src=\"./documentation/images/mobile-ui.png\" width=\"70%\" height=\"70%\"></a></p>\n\n\n## Where to go from here ...\n\nYou may also be interested in\n\n* Configuring additional [Devices](https://www.thing-it.com/thing-it/#/documentationPanel/mobileClient/deviceConfiguration), \n[Groups](https://www.thing-it.com/thing-it/#/documentationPanel/mobileClient/groupConfiguration), \n[Services](https://www.thing-it.com/thing-it/#/documentationPanel/mobileClient/serviceConfiguration), \n[Event Processing](https://www.thing-it.com/thing-it/#/documentationPanel/mobileClient/eventConfiguration), \n[Storyboards](https://www.thing-it.com/thing-it/#/documentationPanel/mobileClient/storyboard    Configuration) and \n[Jobs](https://www.thing-it.com/thing-it/#/documentationPanel/mobileClient/jobConfiguration) via your **[thing-it] Mobile App**.\n* Use [thing-it.com](https://www.thing-it.com) to safely connect your Node Box from everywhere, manage complex configurations, store and analyze historical data \nand offer your configurations to others on the **[thing-it] Mesh Market**.\n* Explore other Device Plugins like [Texas Instruments Sensor Tag](https://www.npmjs.com/package/thing-it-device-ti-sensortag), [Plugwise Smart Switches](https://www.npmjs.com/package/thing-it-device-plugwise) and many more. For a full set of \nDevice Plugins search for **thing-it-device** on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). \n* Or [write your own Plugins](https://github.com/marcgille/thing-it-node/wiki/Plugin-Development-Concepts).\n",
