Manufacturers of CHPs may use this as an example to implement\na [thing-it-node] Device Plugin for their CHP products.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Installation of NodeJS and [thing-it-node]\n\nFirst, install node.js and **[thing-it-node]** on your Gateway Computer (e.g. Raspberry Pi or C.H.I.P) following the instructions on the [[thing-it-node] Wiki](https://github.com/marcgille/thing-it-node/wiki/Raspberry-Pi-Installation).\n \n### Initialization and Start of [thing-it-node] \n\nThe **[thing-it-device-chp]** Plugin is installed with **[thing-it-node]**, hence there is no need to install it separately.\n\nThe Plugin is simulation-only so far, hence you only have to create a directory in which you intend to run the configuration, e.g.\n \n```\nmkdir ~/chp-test\ncd ~/chp-test\n```\n\nand invoke\n\n```\ntin init\n```\n\nand then start **[thing-it-node]** via\n\n```\ntin run\n```\n\nIf you don't want to use Autodiscovery, you may use configurations like the [sample configuration](\"./examples.configuration\") via\n\n```\ntin example --device wind-turbine\n```\n\nIf you want to pair the **[thing-it-node]** Gateway and its sample configuration with [thing-it.com](https://www.thing-it.com), invoke\n\n```\ntin pair --mesh Test\n```\n\nand enter your [thing-it.com](https://www.thing-it.com) account and password. The pairing will allow you to configure and monitor your local Gateway from \n[thing-it.com](https://www.thing-it.com) and use the Mobile App below to connect to the Gateway from everywhere.\n\n## Mobile UI\n\nInstall the **thing-it Mobile App** from the Apple Appstore or Google Play and set it up to connect to **[thing-it-node]** \nlocally as described [here](https://thing-it.com/thing-it/#/documentationPanel/mobileClient/connectionModes) or just connect your browser under \n[http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to check how the Mobile UI would look like.\n\nThe following screenshot shows the Node Page of the [sample configuration](\"./examples.configuration\") with the Mobile UI to monitor and control the CHP:\n\n<p align=\"center\"><a href=\"./documentation/images/mobile-ui.png\"><img src=\"./documentation/images/mobile-ui.png\" width=\"70%\" height=\"70%\"></a></p>\n\n## Where to go from here ...\n\nYou may also be interested in\n\n* Configuring additional [Devices](https://www.thing-it.com/thing-it/#/documentationPanel/mobileClient/deviceConfiguration), \n[Groups](https://www.thing-it.com/thing-it/#/documentationPanel/mobileClient/groupConfiguration), \n[Services](https://www.thing-it.com/thing-it/#/documentationPanel/mobileClient/serviceConfiguration), \n[Event Processing](https://www.thing-it.com/thing-it/#/documentationPanel/mobileClient/eventConfiguration), \n[Storyboards](https://www.thing-it.com/thing-it/#/documentationPanel/mobileClient/storyboard    Configuration) and \n[Jobs](https://www.thing-it.com/thing-it/#/documentationPanel/mobileClient/jobConfiguration) via your **[thing-it] Mobile App**.\n* Use [thing-it.com](https://www.thing-it.com) to safely connect your Node Box from everywhere, manage complex configurations, store and analyze historical data \nand offer your configurations to others on the **[thing-it] Mesh Market**.\n* Explore other Device Plugins like [Texas Instruments Sensor Tag](https://www.npmjs.com/package/thing-it-device-ti-sensortag), [Plugwise Smart Switches](https://www.npmjs.com/package/thing-it-device-plugwise) and many more. For a full set of \nDevice Plugins search for **thing-it-device** on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). \n* Or [write your own Plugins](https://github.com/marcgille/thing-it-node/wiki/Plugin-Development-Concepts).\n",
